#concatenation of Two String Objects
print("String1"+"String2"+"String3")
#the (+) operator is used to combine two strings or more strings but unlike comma separated parameter 
# which provide default space b/w two parameters in string concatenation thats not the case as the are operated by
#+ operator which combine two strings or more strings so we need to provide a space by our self

print("Hello,"+" world!")#here we have provided a space b/w starting qoute and w of world
#another way is :
print("Hello"+","+" "+"world!")#here we have created a space string and concatenated with other  


print('print("hello world of python")')#when we have a statement to print in which there is line involving double quote then that statement should be enclosed by single quote and vice versa
