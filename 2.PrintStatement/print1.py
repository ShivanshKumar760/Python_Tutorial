"""
 suppose we need to print a greeting to someone having name xyz in order to do that
 we have certain ways :

1st way:
 print(" Hello xyz")//thats provide the name of the user inside the double qoute
 well this way is okay when we know the name of user but suppose when we dont know then what?

2nd way
 in order to do that the first approch is store the name in a variable (we will study variable later)
 then use that variable in print withb "+" the + operator help two string concatenate.[print("Hello,"+name)]

3rd way
 another way is use the format string ie fstring//we will see this later """

#lets see first way:
print("Hello,Shivansh")
