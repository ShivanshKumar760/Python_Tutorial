STRING:

String 

A python string is a sequence of character and each character can be individually 
accessed using index.

what is index?

ans:-index are way to mark a element just like in text book or a note there is 
a index to mark page number of a topic to aceess to those topic similarly in 
programming we use indexing to access element like we used in array in C/C++

int array_name={0,3,4,5,7};

to access the element of the array we use indexing and Syntax to do that is :

cout<<array_name[indexno.] 


so in programming we follow 0 based idexing ie counting of element is started from 0

{0 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7}//element 
[0   1   2   3   4]//indexno.

cout<<array_name[1];

output is :3


Similarly in Python String are stored as individual character in contigous memory location
ie continous memory bits ,with two way indexing ie in python we can do reverse 
indexing which we were not able to do in C/C++

lets understand this with an example:

name="PYTHON"

this name variable is holding a string type data so it will be stored in a continous 
memory location

-6  -5   -4  -3  -2   -1//reverse indexing 

[P| Y  | T  | H | O   |N]

0   1    2    3   4    5//forward indexing


Thus ,we can acsess any character as <string name>[<indexno.>] example to acess the first character of string
name="PYTHON" we'll write name[0] because the index of first character is 0(forward indexing) or -6(backward)


In a string ,say name="PYTHON" of length ln,the valid indices are 0,1,2-----ln-1.That means ,if you try to give 
something like :
>>>name[ln]

Python will give / return error like this :
IndexError : String index out of range.

the reason is obvious that in string there is no index equal to the length of the string,thus accessing 
an element like this causes an error.

Also another thing that we should /must know is that we cannot change the individual letters of a string in 
place 
by assignment because string are immutable and hence item assignment is not supported ie

name="hello"
name[0]="p"

will cause an error like :

TypeError:'str' object does not support item assignment

However , we can assign to a string another string or an expression that returns a string using assignment
eg:following statement is valid.

name="hello"
name="new"#string can be assigned expression that give strings
