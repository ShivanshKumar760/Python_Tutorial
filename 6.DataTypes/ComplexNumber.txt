Python represent complex Numebr in the form of A+Bj.That is ,to represent
imaginary Numebr,Python uses j(or J) in place of traditional i.so in Pyhon j=(-1)^(1/2) 
ie under root(-1).Consider the following example where a and b are storing two complex Numebr
in python.

a=0+3.1j
b=1.5+2j

The above complex Numebr a has real number component as 0 and imaginary number component as 3.1
.In complex  number b the real number component is 1.5 and imaginary number component is 2.

When we display the complex number ,Python actuall displays the complex number in paranthesis 
when they have a non zero real number component.
