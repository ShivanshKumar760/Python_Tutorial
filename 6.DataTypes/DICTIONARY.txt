Dictionary
Dictionary is an unordered set of a key-value pair of items. It is like an associative array or a hash table where each key stores a specific value. Key can hold any primitive data type, whereas value is an arbitrary Python object.

The items in the dictionary are separated with the comma (,) and enclosed in the curly braces {}.

Consider the following example.

d = {1:'Jimmy', 2:'Alex', 3:'john', 4:'mike'}     
  
# Printing dictionary  
print (d)  
  
# Accesing value using keys  
print("1st name is "+d[1])   
print("2nd name is "+ d[4])    
  
print (d.keys())    
print (d.values())
