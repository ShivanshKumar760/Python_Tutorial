"""
In Python 3.x , to get input from user interactively ,we can use built in function input().The function input()
is used in the following manner:

variable_to_hold_the_value = input(<prompt or user info to be displayed>)

for example ,
name = input("What is your name ?")

The above statement will display the prompt in shell as:
What is your name ?   //after which we need to type the value.

"""
name = input("What is your name ?")
