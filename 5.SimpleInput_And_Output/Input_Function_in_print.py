Syntax:
print(input(<prompt for user>))

example:
print("What is your name?",input("Enter your name:"))

what this will do is when python interpreter will interperet this line first it will read whole line and 
after encountering input() function first it will direct the program to take input and then print the value 
without storing the value.
